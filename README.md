## Major Design Decisions and Tradeoffs
1. Distributed Tracing Implementation
Decision: Implement OpenTelemetry as the primary instrumentation framework with end-to-end distributed tracing.
Rationale: OpenTelemetry offers vendor-neutral instrumentation that works across multiple programming languages and frameworks, allowing consistent observability across Atlan's heterogeneous tech stack. It enables correlation between logs, metrics, and traces which is essential for rapid troubleshooting.
Tradeoffs:
Pro: Comprehensive visibility into request flows across service boundaries
Pro: Industry standard with broad community support and integrations
Con: Additional overhead in terms of performance and development effort
Con: Requires instrumentation across all services for full effectiveness
Mitigation: Implement sampling strategies to reduce overhead in high-throughput environments while maintaining visibility for problem scenarios.
2. Centralized Logging with Structured Format
Decision: Standardize on structured JSON logging with mandatory context fields across all services.
Rationale: Structured logs enable more effective searching, filtering, and analysis compared to plain text logs. Consistent fields (traceId, requestId, etc.) allow correlation between different system components.
Tradeoffs:
Pro: Dramatically improved searchability and analytical capabilities
Pro: Enables automated analysis and pattern recognition
Con: Larger log storage requirements
Con: May require refactoring of existing logging practices
Mitigation: Implement log retention policies based on importance, and use sampling for high-volume, low-value logs.
3. Service Mesh Integration
Decision: Leverage service mesh technology for network-level telemetry and consistent observability.
Rationale: Service mesh provides network-level visibility without requiring code changes, ensuring consistent basic observability even for services that lack proper instrumentation.
Tradeoffs:
Pro: Provides baseline observability with minimal code changes
Pro: Consistent metrics collection across all services
Con: Additional infrastructure complexity
Con: Not a complete replacement for application-level instrumentation
Mitigation: Implement progressively, starting with critical services, and use as a complement to (not replacement for) application instrumentation.
4. Self-Service Observability Portal
Decision: Create a centralized developer portal for accessing logs, metrics, and traces.
Rationale: A unified interface reduces the learning curve and creates a single entry point for all debugging needs, making it accessible to engineers of all experience levels.
Tradeoffs:
Pro: Democratizes access to observability data
Pro: Reduces dependency on experienced engineers
Con: Requires ongoing maintenance and development
Con: Another tool for engineers to learn
Mitigation: Design for simplicity first, with progressive complexity for advanced users.

## Proof of Solution

1. Issue 1: Slow Debugging Experience
Problem: Finding the cause of issues is slow and manual.
Solution Components:
Distributed tracing showing exact request paths and bottlenecks
Structured logs with context for easier searching
Centralized dashboard showing golden signals and key metrics
Automatic correlation between related telemetry data
Proof: Engineers can instantly visualize the full request path, seeing where time is spent and which components are failing, reducing diagnostic time from hours to minutes.
2. Issue 2: Repetitive Debugging Tasks
Problem: Same debugging steps performed repeatedly.
Solution Components:
Templated dashboards that work across services
Pre-built diagnostic queries and alerts
Automated analysis for common failure patterns
Self-service runbooks integrated with observability data
Proof: Common issues can be diagnosed using standard templates and automated analysis, eliminating the need to repeatedly build custom queries.
3. Issue 3: Inconsistent Debugging Approaches
Problem: Different engineers debug differently, leading to inconsistent results.
Solution Components:
Standardized observability framework across services
Consistent instrumentation patterns via shared libraries
Unified portal for accessing all telemetry data
Documented troubleshooting patterns and procedures
Proof: All engineers, regardless of experience level, follow similar debugging paths using the same tools and data.
4. Issue 4: Dependency on Experienced Engineers
Problem: Only experienced engineers can effectively debug issues.
Solution Components:
Self-service portal with guided troubleshooting
Automated root cause suggestions
Knowledge base integrated with observability tools
Clear visualization of system dependencies and behavior
Proof: Junior engineers can resolve an increasing percentage of issues without escalation, as evidenced by tracking issue resolution distribution across team members.

## Known Gaps and Limitations
1. Legacy Service Integration
Gap: Older services may lack the hooks needed for comprehensive instrumentation.
Why Safe to Ignore: The service mesh approach provides basic observability for these services without code changes. Full instrumentation can be added progressively during feature development rather than as a big-bang effort.
2. Data Volume and Cost Management
Gap: The solution will generate significantly more telemetry data, potentially increasing storage costs.
Why Safe to Ignore: The benefits of faster debugging and reduced engineering time far outweigh storage costs. Sampling strategies and retention policies will be implemented to manage costs while maintaining sufficient visibility.
3. Training and Adoption Curve
Gap: Engineers will need time to learn and adopt new observability tools and practices.
Why Safe to Ignore: The investment in training will pay dividends through faster issue resolution and less dependent debugging. The unified portal approach minimizes the learning curve by providing a single entry point.
4. Complete Historical Data
Gap: Full historical telemetry data may not be available for all services immediately.
Why Safe to Ignore: The system will provide immediate value for new issues, while historical context will build over time. The focus should be on current and future reliability rather than historical analysis.
5. Non-Technical Business Impact Correlation
Gap: Automated correlation between technical issues and business metrics requires additional work.
Why Safe to Ignore: The core technical debugging improvements deliver the most immediate value. Business impact correlation can be added incrementally as the observability culture matures.
